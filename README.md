# cloud-lab-terraform

Hi, I’m Nkechi Ahanonye 👋  
This repo is where I practice Terraform and explore how infrastructure is managed in the cloud.

## 🌍 What’s Inside

A few basic Terraform configurations for AWS:

```
cloud-lab-terraform/
├── ec2-instance.tf      # Launch a test EC2 VM
├── s3-bucket.tf         # Create an S3 bucket with versioning
├── iam-role.tf          # Sample IAM role setup
└── variables.tf         # Inputs for customization
```

---

## 🛠️ How I Use It

```bash
terraform init      # Set up the working directory
terraform plan      # Check the deployment plan
terraform apply     # Create the resources
terraform destroy   # Tear everything down
```

Requires:
- Terraform installed
- AWS CLI configured with credentials

## 📚 Why I’m Doing This

- To understand how Terraform works  
- To gain confidence with AWS resources  
- To prepare for DevOps roles where cloud automation is key
